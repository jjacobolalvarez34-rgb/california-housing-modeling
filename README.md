# California-House-Modeling

Academic project developed during the **Modeling and Simulation I** course as part of the Mathematics undergraduate program.

The objective of this project was to analyze a housing dataset and build predictive models capable of estimating property prices based on physical, geographical, and socioeconomic characteristics.

## Objectives

* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* Identify relevant variables for price prediction.
* Apply data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
* Build and compare different predictive models.
* Evaluate model performance using regression metrics.
* Analyze underfitting and overfitting behavior.

* Geographic analysis using latitude and longitude variables

### Data Preprocessing

* Missing value imputation
* One-Hot Encoding
* Feature scaling
* Feature selection

### Predictive Models

* Linear Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Random Forest Regressor
* Neural Networks (MLP)

### Model Optimization

## Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using:

* R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
* MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-Learn
* TensorFlow / Keras (if applicable)

---

## Results

Multiple predictive approaches were compared to identify the methodology with the strongest predictive performance for the housing dataset.

The project also explored the impact of preprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, and hyperparameter tuning on model accuracy and generalization.
